description: Use when the clodex router or clodex-plan hands off a run at stage `build`, when a resumed run has an approved plan whose batches are not all committed and reviewed, or when a plan assumption turns out to be wrong while implementation is already in flight.
---

# clodex-build — small batches, an explicit contract, a reviewed delta

## Overview

This stage turns an approved plan into commits. It owes the run one thing per
batch, and all of it is fact in the event log rather than claim in a transcript:

| Fact | Event | In the manifest |
|---|---|---|
| what this batch may touch | `batch:opened` | `batches[].owned_paths` |
| the delta was reviewed, and the verdict | `batch:reviewed` | `batches[].delta_review` |
| the commit it landed in | `batch:committed` | `batches[].commit` |

Plus, when an assumption breaks mid-flight, a **plan amendment** — never silent
drift.

**Where this stage ends.** You prove each batch against its own test
expectations: the profile's test command green, plus your review of the delta.
You do **not** run the plan's declared evidence classes, record
`verification:evidence`, or decide anything about verification debt — that is
`clodex-verify`. You do not write the changelog, bump the version, tag, push, or
deploy — that is `clodex-ship`, and §2 makes those files forbidden to you.

You arrive here from `clodex` (which owns preflight, the profile, and the run
directory) or from `clodex-plan` (which owns the plan, its owned paths, and its
approval). If you were invoked without an absolute run directory, **stop and
invoke `clodex`** — do not go looking for a run yourself.

---

## 0. Paths and commands

```bash
CLODEX_HOME="${CLODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/clodex}"   # the router's dir, not this one
STATE="$CLODEX_HOME/state/clodex_state.py"
RUNNER="$CLODEX_HOME/runner/run-codex.sh"
RUN_DIR="<the absolute run dir you were handed>"
SNAP="$(python3 "$STATE" rebuild "$RUN_DIR")"
REPO="$(printf '%s' "$SNAP" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["repo"])')"
PLAN="$(printf '%s' "$SNAP" | python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["plan"]["path"] or "")')"
cd "$REPO"
PROFILE="$REPO/.clodex/profile.json"
```

Shell variables do not survive between command invocations — **re-establish this
block at the top of every shell you run these procedures in.** Everything below
runs from `$REPO`; `git add`, `git status`, and the profile reads all resolve
relative paths against the current directory, so from a subdirectory they answer
the wrong question.

Engine verbs, payload on **stdin**:

```bash
python3 "$STATE" status  "$RUN_DIR"     # human summary
python3 "$STATE" rebuild "$RUN_DIR"     # the manifest: full snapshot JSON
python3 "$STATE" append  "$RUN_DIR" < event.json
```

"The **manifest**" below always means the output of `rebuild`. Append exit codes
and the lock rules live in the `clodex` skill, §"Paths and commands" and §2 —
read them there. The one that bites: exit **3** means the event *is* durably
logged; run `rebuild`, do not retry.

Write every event to a file with your file-writing tool and pipe the file in.
Plan notes, finding summaries, and commit subjects contain quotes; shell
interpolation will corrupt them.

This stage appends eight event types and no others: `stage:build:entered`,
`batch:opened`, `batch:reviewed`, `batch:committed`, `finding:recorded`,
`finding:disposed`, `plan:amended`, `approval:granted`.

---

## 1. Take the handoff

```bash
python3 "$STATE" status "$RUN_DIR"
```

- `stage: plan` → append your entry event, once:
  ```json
  {"e": "stage:build:entered"}
  ```
- `stage: build` → a previous session already entered. **Do not append it
  again.** The engine accepts a duplicate silently — nothing stops you but this
  sentence — and a second entry event makes the log claim a stage started twice.
  Read the manifest and pick up from the resume map.
- `open` → there is no approved plan yet. Hand back: *"clodex, run dir `<the
  absolute run dir>` — this run is at stage `open`, not build."*
- `verify`, `ship`, `closed` → you are past this stage. Hand back the same way.
  You **cannot** re-enter an earlier stage: the reducer refuses it with *"stage
  would move backwards"*.

**Then, before any batch: confirm the plan is actually approved.** Building
without a standing approval is building against nothing:

```bash
python3 - "$STATE" "$RUN_DIR" <<'PY'
import json, subprocess, sys
snap = json.loads(subprocess.check_output(["python3", sys.argv[1], "rebuild", sys.argv[2]]))
plan = snap["plan"]
live = [a for a in snap["approvals"] if a["revoked"] is None and a["scope"] == "plan"]
print("plan:", plan["path"], "v%s" % plan["version"], (plan["hash"] or "-")[:12])
print("standing plan approval:", bool(live))
print("open findings:", [f["id"] for f in snap["findings"] if f["disposition"] == "open"] or "none")
PY
```

No standing approval, or an open finding → the plan stage did not finish. Say so
and hand back to `clodex`. An approval with `revoked: null` is necessarily bound
to the current `plan.hash` (the engine refuses any other), so that one boolean
is the whole test.

Then **recompute the plan file's hash and compare it to `plan.hash`**:

```bash
python3 -c 'import hashlib,sys;print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],"rb").read()).hexdigest())' "$PLAN"
```

Different means someone edited the plan without amending. That is §11, not a
shrug.

**Resume map** — read the manifest and match the first row that is true:

| What you find | You are | Go to |
|---|---|---|
| no `batches` entries | nothing started | §2 |
| a batch with `delta_review: null` | opened — whether the implementer ran is a fact about the tree, not the log | §7 first: its check is read-only and tells you which. If `git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all -- <that batch's owned paths>` also prints nothing, no work exists yet — go to §6 and run the implementer. |
| a batch with `delta_review: "fail"` | a review you have not answered | §9 |
| a batch reviewed `pass` with `commit: null` | reviewed, not committed | §10 |
| `plan.amendments` non-empty and its `required_review` unsatisfied | mid amendment | §11, step 6 |
| every planned batch committed and passed | done | §12 |

---

## 2. What the profile forbids you

Read it before you write a contract. Every batch is bound by what it says:

```bash
python3 - "$PROFILE" <<'PY'
import json, sys
p = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))
cl, ver, tag, br = p.get("changelog"), p["version"], p["tag"], p["branch"]
print("test (the micro-gate):", p["commands"]["test"] or "(none)")
print("FORBIDDEN changelog:  ", (cl or {}).get("path") or "(repo keeps none)")
print("FORBIDDEN version:    ", ver.get("source") or "(repo is unversioned)")
print("FORBIDDEN tags:       ", (tag["format"] or "?") if tag["enabled"] else "(tagging off)")
print("branch:               ", br["default"], "| work_on_default:", br["work_on_default"],
      "| naming:", br.get("naming") or "-")
PY
```

### The release-owned set — build never touches it

**The changelog, the version source, and tags belong to `clodex-ship`.** Ship
closes them from evidence, with one authoritative timestamp, inside the release
authorization the user approves. A batch that edits them has written the release
before anyone authorized it, and ship cannot tell your edit from its own.

So, in every batch, whatever the plan says:

| Forbidden | Which file, concretely | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| the changelog | the profile's `changelog.path` (e.g. `CHANGELOG.md`) | `clodex-ship` |
| the version | the profile's `version.source` (e.g. `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `VERSION`) | `clodex-ship` |
| tags | no `git tag` in this stage, at all | `clodex-ship` |
| the repo profile | `.clodex/profile.json` — never edited, never staged, never committed here | the router, with the user |
| run state | `.clodex/<run-id>/` — only the state engine writes there | the engine |

**May build touch the changelog? No.** Not "usually not", not "unless the plan
asked": no. If the plan's Batches table lists the changelog or the version source
as an owned path, that is a defect in the plan — amend it (§11) with the path
removed, and say why. If the user asks for a changelog entry mid-build, the
answer is that ship writes it from the run's evidence and it will be there.

The lockfile a package manager rewrites, a formatter's incidental reflow, a
config file "while we're in there" — none of these is owned unless the plan says
so. Not owned means forbidden (§5).

---

## 3. The change boundary — before you open your first batch

The `clodex` skill's §5B is **yours to execute**. It could not run earlier: the
router has no owned paths yet, and the approval event it may need binds to a plan
hash the reducer refuses until a plan is recorded. Run it now, once, before the
first `batch:opened`.

Compare the plan's owned paths (its Batches table, all rows) against the dirty
snapshot the user acknowledged at open:

```bash
python3 - "$STATE" "$RUN_DIR" "src/thing/" "docs/plans/<plan file>.md" <<'PY'
import json, subprocess, sys
state, run_dir, owned = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3:]
snap = json.loads(subprocess.check_output(["python3", state, "rebuild", run_dir]))

def under(path, prefix):                  # path IS prefix, or sits inside it
    return path == prefix.rstrip("/") or path.startswith(prefix.rstrip("/") + "/")

def tree():                               # every path git reports right now
    raw = subprocess.check_output(
        ["git", "status", "--porcelain", "-z", "--untracked-files=all"]).decode()
    fields, i, out = raw.split("\0"), 0, []
    while i < len(fields) and fields[i]:
        entry = fields[i]; i += 1
        out.append(entry[3:])
        if entry[0] in ("R", "C"):
            out.append(fields[i]); i += 1     # a rename's origin path
    return out

# A directory-shaped entry hides every file under it — expand it before comparing.
dirty, current = [], tree()
for d in snap["git"]["dirty_at_start"]:
    inside = [p for p in current if under(p, d)] if d.endswith("/") else []
    dirty.extend(inside or [d])

hits = sorted({d for d in dirty for o in owned if under(d, o) or under(o, d)})
print("dirty at start:", " ".join(snap["git"]["dirty_at_start"]) or "(clean tree)")
print("resolved to:   ", " ".join(sorted(set(dirty))) or "(nothing)")
print("overlap:       ", " ".join(hits) if hits else "(none)")
PY
```

Pass every owned path of every batch as an argument — an overlap the second batch
will hit is still an overlap.

**Overlap is tested in both directions, and directory entries are expanded, on
purpose.** An acknowledged entry can be an **ancestor** of an owned path:
`dirty_at_start` of `["docs/"]` against an owned `docs/plans/` is an overlap,
because the user's `docs/plans/older-draft.md` sits inside a path this run is
about to stage. A test that only asks "is the dirty path inside an owned path"
answers `(none)` there, and their file lands in a clodex commit with nothing
downstream noticing. The current router records the dirty snapshot file by file,
so this should not arise — but a run opened by an older version, or any
regression upstream, must not silently re-open it, which is why the check does
not trust the shape of what it was handed.

- **`overlap: (none)`** → proceed to §4. The other dirty paths are not yours:
  never stage them, never revert them, never mention them in a contract except as
  forbidden.
- **Anything listed** → stop and take it to the user under `clodex` §5B, which
  defines the three legal outcomes and the exact commands and event payload for
  each. Do not paraphrase them and do not invent a fourth. Fold is the only one
  that continues this run in place; isolate restarts from the router in a
  worktree; abort ends here.

---

## 4. Branch discipline

You make the run's first commit, so the profile's branch rule binds here.

`work_on_default: true` → commit on the current branch, nothing to do.

`work_on_default: false` → the run works on its own branch. Check where you are,
and if you are on the default branch, say the exact command in chat and run it in
the same turn:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
git checkout -b clodex/<run-id>        # or whatever branch.naming says, filled in
```

The manifest's `branch` field records where the run *opened*; it is not updated
by a checkout, and no event changes it. Tell the user the branch name you created
— `clodex-ship` will need it, and the manifest will not say it.

---

## 5. The batch contract

A **batch** is one bounded unit of implementation work. `clodex-plan` gave each
one its owned paths and its *Done when*. The contract is the rest, and it is a
**file you write**, not an intention you hold: it goes to the implementer as a
hashed input, and the envelope proves which contract the work was done under.

Write `$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.contract.md`. Every heading is required.

```markdown
# Batch <N> contract — run <run-id>

Plan: <plan path> v<version>, hash <first 12 of plan.hash>
Done when: <the batch's "Done when", verbatim from the plan's Batches table>

## Owned paths — the only paths this batch may create or modify
- `src/thing/`
- `docs/plans/<plan file>.md`

## Forbidden paths
- `<profile changelog.path>` — release-owned, written by clodex-ship
- `<profile version.source>` — release-owned, written by clodex-ship
- git tags — no `git tag` in this stage, at all
- `.clodex/profile.json` — committed repo state this stage never edits or stages
- `.clodex/<run-id>/` — run state; only the state engine writes there
- `<every other batch's owned paths, listed>`
- `<every path in git.dirty_at_start this batch does not own>` — someone else's
  uncommitted work
- **Everything else in the repo. Not owned means forbidden.**

## Test expectations
- `<profile commands.test>` exits 0 — the micro-gate
- <the new or changed test that proves this batch's Done when, by name>
- <or, when commands.test is null: "this repo has no test command; the delta
  review is the whole gate", and say what you will read instead>
```

Three things make this contract useful rather than decorative:

1. **Owned paths are copied from the plan, not reinterpreted.** If they are
   wrong or insufficient, that is an amendment (§11), not a quiet widening.
2. **Forbidden paths are named literally**, filled in from §2's output — not
   "release files".
3. **Test expectations are commands**, not adjectives. "Tests pass" is not a test
   expectation; `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests` exiting 0 is.

Batches run one at a time, in the plan's order. **The next batch does not open
until the current one is reviewed `pass` and committed** (§12's exit check is the
same rule).

---

## 6. Open the batch, then run the implementer

First, capture the **pre-invocation baseline** — the tree exactly as it stands
this moment. §7 classifies against it, because everything already changed *now*
is provably not this batch's work:

```bash
git -C "$REPO" status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all > "$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.pre"
```

Then append, with the owned paths exactly as the contract lists them:

```json
{"e": "batch:opened", "id": 1, "owned_paths": ["src/thing/", "docs/plans/2026-08-11-thing.md"]}
```

Ids are unique for the life of the run: a second `batch:opened` with the same id
is refused — *"batch 1 is already open"*. A batch is never re-opened; work that
has to be redone gets a **new** batch (§11).

Before you write the prompt, read the manifest's `findings` for entries with
`disposition: "deferred-to-build"` whose note names this batch. Each one goes
into the prompt's "What to build" as an explicit item — plan review deferred it
to exactly this moment, and a deferred finding the batch never sees was
silently dropped, not deferred.

Write the prompt to `$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.prompt.md` with your file-writing tool —
never as a shell string. It has exactly these parts, in this order:

```markdown
Implement one batch of an approved plan. The repo root is your working directory
and you may edit files in it directly.

Plan: <the value of $PLAN> — read it. This is batch <N> of its Batches table.
Contract: <$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.contract.md> — read it. It binds you.

What to build:
<the batch's Done when, plus the two or three sentences of the plan that give it
context. Do not restate the plan; it is a file you just told them to read.>

Rules, and they override anything the plan implies:
- Create or modify only the contract's owned paths. Nothing else — not a config,
  not a lockfile, not a neighbouring module you noticed on the way past.
- Never touch a forbidden path.
- Never run `git add`, `git commit`, `git tag`, `git push`, `git checkout`, or
  `git stash`. You edit the working tree; the orchestrator reviews and commits.
- This tree contains other people's uncommitted work. Leave it exactly as it is.

Done means: <the profile's test command> exits 0, and <the batch's test
expectation>.

Report what you changed, file by file, and anything you could not finish. Set
status `partial` if any part of this assignment is undone — a `complete` you
cannot stand behind costs more to unwind than a `partial` costs to resume.
```

Run it. The implementer role runs in codex's `workspace-write` sandbox and edits
files directly:

```bash
CONTRACT="$RUN_DIR/batch-1.contract.md"
PROMPT="$RUN_DIR/batch-1.prompt.md"
OUT="$(bash "$RUNNER" --role implementer --repo "$REPO" \
        --run-id "$(basename "$RUN_DIR")" \
        --prompt-file "$PROMPT" --input "$CONTRACT" --input "$PLAN")"; RC=$?
printf 'rc=%s line=%s\n' "$RC" "$OUT"
ENVELOPE="${OUT#* }"     # strip the FIRST word only — a repo path may contain spaces
```

The runner prints one line, `"<status> <envelope-path>"`, and **its exit code is
the authority**. Never read status out of prose, stderr, or the model's summary.

| rc | Status | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | `complete` | Go to §7. "Complete" means it finished its assignment, not that the work is right. |
| 2 | `partial` | It stopped short. Resume: the runner printed a runnable one-command resume line on stderr — surface it and run it. Do not start a fresh invocation; the work is half-done in the tree. |
| 3 | `interrupted` | Same as partial: resume with the printed command. |
| 1 | `failed` | Read the envelope's `error` and `output.stderr`. The tree may still have been edited — run §7 before deciding anything. |
| 64 | usage error | You called the runner wrong. Fix the arguments. |
| — | empty `$OUT` | The runner died before writing an envelope. Read its stderr. |

Confirm the envelope worked from the contract you wrote, the same way
`clodex-plan` confirms a review hashed the current plan:

```bash
python3 - "$ENVELOPE" "$CONTRACT" <<'PY'
import hashlib, json, sys
env = json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))
want = hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[2], "rb").read()).hexdigest()
print("status:", env["status"], "invocation:", env["invocation_id"])
print("worked from this exact contract:", any(i["sha256"] == want for i in env["inputs"]))
for f in env["findings"]:
    print(f["id"], f["severity"], "|", f["summary"], "|", f["location"])
PY
```

An implementer may report findings of its own — something it could not do, a
defect it noticed. Record and dispose them like any other (§9).

---

## 7. The boundary check — did it stay inside the contract?

Run this **every time the implementer returns**, whatever its status. A
`workspace-write` sandbox can write anywhere in the repo; the contract is a
promise, and this is the check.

```bash
python3 "$STATE" boundary-check "$RUN_DIR" \
    --owned "src/thing/" --owned "docs/plans/<plan file>.md" \
    --baseline "$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.pre"
```

Pass this batch's owned paths only, and always pass the baseline §6 captured.
The verb encodes what the hand-written check used to carry: it classifies every
path `git status --porcelain -z --untracked-files=all` reports — untracked
files expanded, and rename **origins** included, since a staged move out of an
unowned path into an owned one must count against the origin or the batch
commits a file it never owned — and exits non-zero when any `STRAY` exists.

**The baseline, not `dirty_at_start`, is the acknowledged set.** The at-open
snapshot is stale within minutes in a repo with a concurrent session:
comparing against it once printed `STOP — 9 path(s)` where none of the nine
was the implementer's, and the remedy below would have reverted six of another
session's working files. Everything already changed when the baseline was
written is provably not this batch's work. Omitting `--baseline` falls back to
`dirty_at_start` (ancestors resolved) — legal, but only when no baseline
exists, which for a batch you opened with §6 is never.

What comes back:

| Result | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `clean — the contract held` | nothing changed outside the owned paths except what the baseline already held | §8 |
| exit 1 + a path marked **STRAY** | the implementer strayed — or something else wrote after the baseline; the second source below tells them apart | Stop. This is a scope change, and scope changes are the user's call. Capture it, show it, ask (below). |
| a path marked **acknowledged** | it was already changed when the baseline was captured | Leave it alone. It is not yours to stage, revert, or clean, and it is **never** a target of the restore below. The check cannot tell "still only their edit" from "the implementer edited it too" — the diff below answers that. |
| a path marked **profile** (`.clodex/profile.json`) | the router repaired the profile and did not commit it, or the user edited it | Leave it, and say so in chat. It is the one file `git check-ignore` lets through, and it is never yours to stage (§2). |

Read-only, for an acknowledged path you suspect the implementer also touched —
everything that happened to it since the run opened:

```bash
git diff "$(python3 "$STATE" rebuild "$RUN_DIR" |
            python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(sys.stdin)["git"]["start_head"])')" \
    -- <the acknowledged path>
```

More there than the user's own edit means treat it as a stray after all. It
still never becomes a target of the restore below: their edit is mixed into that
file, so undoing the implementer's part is theirs to do, not yours.

For a path the check printed as **STRAY** — and only those — first consult the
**second source**: the implementer's own account of what it changed, in its
envelope's report and its event stream. A stray the implementer's record names
is its work. A stray its record does **not** name is far more likely another
actor's, arrived in the window after the baseline — and **a restore is never
offered for a path the run cannot prove the implementer touched**. Treat that
path as the user's: show it, say the record does not claim it, and leave every
restore command out of the message.

For provably-the-implementer's strays, capture the evidence before anything
changes:

```bash
git diff -- <stray tracked paths> > "$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.stray.diff"
git status --short --untracked-files=all -- <stray paths>
```

Then put it to the user with the diff and exactly two ways forward: **the stray
edit is needed** — that is a scope change, so amend the plan (§11) to own the
path, and the work continues; or **it is not needed** — restore those paths and
re-run the batch. Restore only after they say so, and only paths the check
itself listed as `STRAY` **and** the implementer's record claims.

Which command applies is the `[XY]` the check printed beside the path:

| `[XY]` | What it is | Restore with |
|---|---|---|
| `[??]` | untracked — git has never seen it, so there is nothing to restore it *to* | `mv` it aside |
| `[R ]`, `[RM]`, `[C ]` | a **rename or copy the implementer staged**, and this is its origin path | unstage the rename first, then restore |
| anything else | tracked, and modified in place | `git checkout --` puts the committed content back |

```bash
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/stray"
git checkout -- <stray paths the check printed with a plain tracked [XY]>
mv <stray path the check printed as [??]> "$RUN_DIR/stray/"    # never rm
```

**A rename origin needs its own three steps, and `git checkout` alone is not one
of them.** When the implementer moved a file *into* the contract from outside it,
the origin path no longer exists in the index or the tree, so
`git checkout -- <origin>` fails with *"pathspec … did not match any file(s)
known to git"* and leaves you nowhere. Undo the rename in the index first — the
operation that actually restores it:

```bash
mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/stray"
git reset -q HEAD -- <origin path> <the new path it was moved to>   # index only, never the tree
git checkout -- <origin path>                    # now it exists in the index again
mv <the new path> "$RUN_DIR/stray/"              # the moved copy, untracked after the reset
```

`git reset` with a pathspec touches only the index — it cannot discard a working
tree change, so it cannot reach anybody's edits. After it, the origin reads as
deleted and the destination as untracked, which is exactly the state the two
lines below it expect.

**Do not select these paths by hand, and do not re-derive them.** "Not in
`dirty_at_start`" is not the test — a file inside an acknowledged *directory* is
not in that list either, and using it as the guard is how the user's untracked
work in progress ends up moved out of their tree. The only paths eligible here
are the ones the check printed as `STRAY` and the implementer's record claims;
a path printed as `acknowledged` is out of scope for both commands above,
always.

`git checkout -- <path>` is on the router's never-run list (`clodex` §5B), and
this is the one place it is defensible: the path is not acknowledged, so it
was clean when the run opened, which means the only edit being discarded is the
implementer's own — captured in the diff above, and only after the user said to.
Outside that guard the rule stands unchanged.

A release-owned file among the strays (§2) is the one case where the answer is
not open: it is restored, never folded. Ship owns it.

---

## 8. The micro-gate

**The gate is the profile's `commands.test`, green.** One command, run from the
repo root:

```bash
TEST_CMD="$(python3 -c 'import json,sys;print(json.load(open(sys.argv[1]))["commands"]["test"] or "")' "$PROFILE")"
if [ -n "$TEST_CMD" ]; then
    bash -c "$TEST_CMD"; echo "gate rc=$?"
else
    echo "no test command in this profile — no micro-gate to run"
fi
```

Use the `if`, not `[ -n "$TEST_CMD" ] && …`. With `commands.test: null` the test
itself is what fails, so the one-liner prints `gate rc=1` — a red gate in a repo
that has no gate, sending you to fix a failure that does not exist.

**If you pipe the gate — through `tail`, `tee`, anything — the rc you print
must be `${PIPESTATUS[0]}` under `set -o pipefail`, never `$?`.** After a pipe,
`$?` is the LAST command's exit: a gate that died on ENOENT has printed
`gate rc=0` twice in one day because `$?` was `tail`'s. The unpiped form above
needs nothing; the moment a pipe appears, so does `PIPESTATUS`.

**A bare rc is not evidence — a gate result carries a pass count.** Quote the
runner's own summary line (`142 passed`, `559 / 87 skipped`) beside the rc.
The count is what makes a green gate comparable to its baseline and a silently
shrunk suite visible; `rc=0` alone says only that *something* exited cleanly.

**A batch containing a rebase or merge resolution owes a test-inventory
diff.** A conflict resolution can delete a test silently, and every
count-based gate stays green, because a baseline that moves during a rebase is
no baseline — it happened, and the deleted regression test was found only by
an adversarial review. List test NAMES before and after (the runner's
`--list-tests` / `--collect-only`, or grepping the test declarations), diff
them, and carry the diff into §9's verdict as its own item: a missing name is
a finding, not a smaller number.

- **rc 0** → green. Continue to §9.
- **non-zero** → red. The delta does not leave this stage. Fix it — yourself, or
  by running the implementer again with the failure output in the prompt — and
  run the gate again. Do not review a red delta, do not commit one, and never
  "fix" a gate by changing the test to match the code unless the plan says the
  test was wrong.
- **`commands.test` is null** → there is no gate to run. Say so out loud, in
  chat, once per run: *"this repo's profile has no test command, so batches have
  no automated micro-gate; the delta review is the whole gate."* The verdict in
  §9 is then `pass-no-test-command`, which is how the manifest tells
  `clodex-verify` and `clodex-ship` that nothing was executed here.

`lint` and `typecheck` are `clodex-verify`'s gates. Run them here only if this
batch's contract named them as a test expectation; otherwise leave them, and do
not report their state as if it were a gate you passed.

---

## 9. The delta review — every batch, before the next one opens

"Locally reviewed" is not a feeling. It is these three things, in order.

**(a) Stage the owned paths and read the whole delta yourself.**

```bash
git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all -- src/thing/ docs/plans/<plan file>.md
```

**Every path that lists must be one this batch authored.** Staging a *directory*
stages whatever is inside it, including a file the user left there — so if
anything in that list is not yours, do not `git add` the directory: add the files
by name. Then go back to §3, because an unowned file inside an owned directory
means the overlap resolution was skipped or answered wrong, and the fix belongs
there, with the user, not here.

```bash
git add -- src/thing/ docs/plans/<plan file>.md      # explicit paths, never -A, never .
git status --short                                    # see what else is in the index
git diff --cached -- src/thing/ docs/plans/<plan file>.md > "$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.diff"
```

Something you do not own may already be staged — a user who ran `git add` on
their own work before the run. **Do not unstage it**; their index is theirs. §10
commits by pathspec, which cannot pick it up.

Read that file end to end and answer all five, in writing, in chat:

1. Is every changed file an owned path? (§7 said yes; the staged diff is the
   second look, and it is the one that becomes a commit.)
2. Does it meet the batch's *Done when* — the checkable sentence, not the vibe?
3. Is anything stubbed, `TODO`-ed, hardcoded, or commented out that the batch
   claims as done?
4. Does it add a credential, token, or key **value** anywhere? Names are fine;
   values never are.
5. Did the micro-gate cover this delta, or does it pass without touching it?

**(b) Run the Codex code-reviewer role when the delta is consequential.**
Consequential is checkable, not a mood — any one of these makes it so:

- it changes anything that runs outside the test suite (any file that is not a
  test, a fixture, a doc, or the plan file); or
- it touches authentication, credentials, permissions, money, data deletion or
  migration, or an external side effect (a network call, a write to a shared
  system); or
- the plan's Risks section names any of this batch's owned paths.

A delta that is only tests, fixtures, docs, comments, or the plan file is not
consequential; your own read (a) is the whole review, and you say so in the
event's note. Everything else gets the reviewer:

```bash
REVIEW_PROMPT="$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.review.prompt.md"     # written with your file tool
OUT="$(bash "$RUNNER" --role code-reviewer --repo "$REPO" \
        --run-id "$(basename "$RUN_DIR")" \
        --prompt-file "$REVIEW_PROMPT" --input "$RUN_DIR/batch-<N>.diff" --input "$PLAN")"; RC=$?
ENVELOPE="${OUT#* }"
```

The prompt says: review this diff against this plan's batch <N> and its *Done
when*; report findings only; do not edit files; blocker/high/medium for anything
that would produce wrong or unshippable work, low/info for improvements. The rc
table in §6 applies unchanged — only a `complete` round is a review.

**(c) Dispose every finding.** Record each one, then dispose it `fixed`,
`accepted`, or `rejected` (`deferred-to-build` has no meaning here — build is
where deferral lands). What carries over unchanged from `clodex-plan` §9:
what each disposition means, that **only the user** may accept or reject one
(and their words go in the `note`) — or a standing mandate granting
`finding-disposition` (`clodex-plan` §6), with `by: "mandate"` and the note
citing it — that nothing is ever dropped, and that severity does not restrict
disposition: an `accepted` blocker is a legitimate end state that survives
into ship.

What does **not** carry over: that skill's `fixed` row says fixing implies an
amendment and a new plan hash, because there the artifact being fixed *is* the
plan. Here, `fixed` almost always means you changed **code** — ordinary batch
work, no amendment, no hash movement, no approvals revoked. A code-review finding
becomes an amendment only when it trips one of §11's triggers, i.e. when the fix
is in the plan rather than in the code. Amending for a code fix would revoke
every approval on the run for nothing.

Namespace ids by batch, because the runner mints `F001` fresh every invocation:

```json
{"e": "finding:recorded", "id": "b1-F001", "source": "code-reviewer",
 "severity": "high", "summary": "<one line, verbatim from the envelope>",
 "location": "<the envelope finding's location, verbatim>",
 "detail": "<the envelope finding's detail, verbatim>",
 "invocation": "<the envelope's invocation id>",
 "codex": {"invocation_id": "<same>", "role": "code-reviewer",
           "status": "complete", "envelope": "<path>",
           "input_hashes": ["<diff sha the envelope records>"], "duration_s": 214}}
```

`source` is the Codex role that produced it — `code-reviewer`, or `implementer`
for a finding the implementer reported itself. A second review round on the same
batch uses `b1r2-F001`.

The `codex` block (`clodex` → Telemetry) goes on the **first** finding of the
invocation; the rest carry `invocation` alone. Every Codex call this stage makes
gets one — the implementer's as well as the reviewer's — because otherwise the
manifest records the batch's *result* and nothing about what it cost to get it.
The implementer's block rides on `batch:committed`, whose `codex` names the role
`implementer`. An invocation that was interrupted and resumed is **two** blocks,
same `invocation_id`, the second `"resumed": true`.

### The verdict

Append it as soon as you have it, before you commit:

```json
{"e": "batch:reviewed", "id": 1, "delta_review": "pass",
 "note": "gate green; code-reviewer complete, 2 findings fixed",
 "invocation": "<the review invocation id, or omitted when there was no review>"}
```

`invocation` reaches the snapshot on the batch, so `rebuild` answers "was this
batch reviewed, and by which round?" without opening the runner directory. A
review that found **nothing** leaves no findings to hang a `codex` block on, so
put it here — otherwise the log cannot tell a clean review from a skipped one.

| `delta_review` | When |
|---|---|
| `pass` | micro-gate green, your five answers clean, and every finding from this batch disposed |
| `pass-no-test-command` | the same, in a repo whose `commands.test` is null (§8) |
| `fail` | anything else |

**When it fails.** Append `fail` first — the log records the verdict you actually
reached, not the one you ended up with. Then fix it inside this same batch: you
fix it, or you run the implementer again with the findings in the prompt (a new
invocation, not `--resume`; the assignment changed). Re-run §7, §8, and §9, then
append `batch:reviewed` again with `pass`. The later event wins;
`batches[].delta_review` shows the current verdict and the log shows both.

**The next batch does not open while any batch's `delta_review` is not a pass.**
That is the rule the whole stage rests on: a delta nobody reviewed cannot be
distinguished, later, from one that was fine.

If the fix turns out to require changing the plan rather than the code — the
finding is right and the plan is wrong — that is §11.

---

## 10. Commit the batch

Only after a `pass` verdict, and immediately after it: a commit is a record of a
reviewed delta, so anything you change between the verdict and the commit makes
the review stale and sends you back to §9.

```bash
if git diff --quiet -- src/thing/ docs/plans/<plan file>.md; then
    git commit -m "<type>(<scope>): <the batch's Done when, in one line>" \
               -- src/thing/ docs/plans/<plan file>.md      # the batch's owned paths
    COMMIT="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
    git show --stat --oneline "$COMMIT"   # read it: owned paths only, nothing else
else
    echo "STOP: an owned path changed after you staged it — the delta you reviewed"
    echo "      is not the delta about to land. Back to §9."
fi
```

The guard is an `if`, not a warning before an unconditional commit. `git diff
--quiet … || echo …` followed by `git commit` prints the warning **and** makes
the stale commit, which then has to be undone — and undoing a commit is a worse
position than never making one.

**Name the paths on the commit too, not just on the `git add`.** A bare `git
commit -m` commits the whole index, and the index is not only yours: a user who
staged their own work before the run has it swept into your commit, silently,
and `git show` is where you would find out. With the pathspec, git commits those
paths and nothing else, and their staged work stays staged.

**That pathspec commits the working tree, not the index** — which is why the
`git diff --quiet` runs first. Given a pathspec, git takes the current file
contents and disregards what you staged, so a file edited after §9 produced its
diff is committed in its newer form, and `git show --stat` will not tell you:
the file list is identical either way, and only the content moved. The guard
holds the commit back exactly when an owned path has unstaged changes, meaning
the delta you reviewed is not the delta about to land.

Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a`, and never `git add <dir>`
when that directory holds files the batch does not own. The change boundary
exists so that other people's work never lands in a clodex commit, and one
convenience flag undoes all of it.

Then append:

```json
{"e": "batch:committed", "id": 1, "commit": "<the full sha from git rev-parse HEAD>"}
```

The batch must already exist — `batch:committed` for an unknown id is refused
with *"no such batch: 9"*.

Now go back to §5 for the next batch, or to §12 if that was the last one.

---

## 11. When an assumption changes: the amendment protocol

Amend when the **plan's text is now false or incomplete**:

- an entry in its Assumptions section turns out not to hold;
- a batch's *Done when* cannot be met as written;
- the work needs a path no batch owns (including a stray the user wants kept, §7);
- an evidence class the plan declared cannot be produced;
- a review finding is right and the fix is in the plan, not the code.

Do **not** amend for something the plan is simply silent about. An implementation
detail it never specified is work, not drift: decide it, write it in the batch
contract, and carry on.

**You cannot hand this back to `clodex-plan`.** The reducer refuses a backwards
stage transition — *"stage would move backwards, build -> plan"* — so the
amendment, its re-review, and its re-approval all happen here.

### Four effects. All four, every time.

| # | Effect | Where you see it |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **The plan hash is superseded.** A new version, a new content hash, and the amendment recorded with its note. | `plan.hash`, `plan.version`, `plan.amendments[]` |
| 2 | **Every approval bound to the old hash is revoked, mechanically.** The reducer sweeps them when the amendment is reduced and marks each **in place** with the superseding hash — kept as revoked, never dropped. It takes the original plan approval, and any `dirty-fold` approval from §3, not just recent ones. | `approvals[].revoked` |
| 3 | **The amendment declares its required re-review.** `clodex-ship` is blocked until that re-review exists against the new hash. | `plan.amendments[].required_review` |
| 4 | **Completed work the change affects is identified** — by batch id and commit sha — and redone in a new batch. | the amendment note, plus the new `batch:opened` |

### The recipe

1. **Stop.** Do not open the next batch and do not keep editing. Say what
   changed, in one message: the assumption, the evidence that broke it, and what
   in the plan is now false.

2. **Identify the affected completed work.** For every batch already committed,
   ask whether the change touches its owned paths or invalidates its *Done when*:

   ```bash
   python3 "$STATE" rebuild "$RUN_DIR" | python3 -c '
   import json,sys
   for b in json.load(sys.stdin)["batches"]:
       print(b["id"], b["commit"], b["delta_review"], b["owned_paths"])'
   ```

   Name them by id and sha in the amendment note. "Nothing completed is affected"
   is a real answer, and it goes in the note too.

3. **Edit the plan file** — the Assumptions entry that broke, plus every section
   the change reaches (Scope, Batches, Evidence, Direction). Bump its version
   line.

4. **Recompute the hash and append `plan:amended`:**

   ```json
   {"e": "plan:amended", "version": 2,
    "path": "docs/plans/<plan file>.md",
    "hash": "<new sha256>",
    "note": "assumption 3 (the API returns ids) is false; batch 1 (sha 1a2b3c4) reworked in batch 3",
    "required_review": ["plan-reviewer", "code-reviewer"]}
   ```

   `required_review` names Codex **roles** and the vocabulary is fixed outside
   this skill: `properties.role.enum` in `$CLODEX_HOME/runner/envelope.schema.json`.
   Whether an amendment is **material** — and therefore whether it needs a
   plan-review round at all — is `clodex-plan` §6's test, unchanged: material
   means it touched Brief, Scope, Batches, Evidence, or Direction. Add
   `code-reviewer` when the amendment invalidates a committed batch's review, so
   the redone work gets looked at against the new plan.

   Two refusals to expect: *"plan:amended must carry the new plan hash"* and
   *"plan:amended does not supersede anything: the hash is unchanged"*. Both mean
   you appended before saving the file.

5. **Look at what it revoked** — this is effect 2, and it is worth reading rather
   than assuming:

   ```bash
   python3 "$STATE" rebuild "$RUN_DIR" | python3 -c '
   import json,sys
   for a in json.load(sys.stdin)["approvals"]:
       r=a["revoked"]
       print(a["scope"], "revoked" if r else "STANDING", r["superseding_hash"][:8] if r else "")'
   ```

6. **Satisfy the declared re-review.** `plan-reviewer` → one round against the
   new plan file, run and read exactly as `clodex-plan` §8 describes, with every
   finding disposed per §9. `code-reviewer` → the affected batches' deltas
   reviewed again against the new plan.

7. **Re-approve, in one message.** Present: what changed and why, the affected
   completed work, the re-review outcome, and — when §3 folded pre-existing work
   — that the `dirty-fold` acknowledgment was revoked with everything else and is
   being re-granted. Then append, bound to the **new** hash:

   ```json
   {"e": "approval:granted", "scope": "plan", "by": "user",
    "plan_version": 2, "plan_hash": "<the new sha256, recomputed from the file>"}
   ```

   This reduces to exactly the entry `clodex-plan`'s `plan:approved` produces —
   same handler, same `scope: "plan"` — so the standing-approval test in §1 and
   at ship is satisfied either way. An approval against the superseded hash is
   refused: *"approval binds to plan hash 'X' but the current plan hash is 'Y'"*.
   Re-grant the `dirty-fold` approval too, with its own `approval:granted`, if
   the folded work is still in scope.

8. **Redo the affected work in a new batch.** Batch ids are never reused —
   `batch:opened` refuses a duplicate. Open the next free id with a fresh contract
   (§5). Its owned paths may overlap an earlier batch's on purpose: the plan-level
   rule that batches are disjoint is about parallel scope, and a remediation batch
   deliberately revisits committed work. The amendment note is the record of why.

---

## 12. Exit

Check it from the manifest and the tree, not from memory. Pass the batch ids the
plan's Batches table lists — the manifest cannot know about a batch nobody ever
opened:

```bash
RUNNER_STATE="${CLODEX_RUNNER_STATE_DIR:-$REPO/.clodex/runner}"
python3 - "$STATE" "$RUN_DIR" "$RUNNER_STATE" 1 2 3 <<'PY'
import glob, hashlib, json, os, subprocess, sys
state, run_dir, runner_state = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], sys.argv[3]
planned = sys.argv[4:]                       # the batch ids in the plan's Batches table
snap = json.loads(subprocess.check_output(["python3", state, "rebuild", run_dir]))
blockers = []

seen = {str(b["id"]) for b in snap["batches"]}
for pid in planned:
    if pid not in seen:
        blockers.append("planned batch %s was never opened" % pid)
for b in snap["batches"]:
    good = bool(b["commit"]) and b["delta_review"] in ("pass", "pass-no-test-command")
    print("batch %-4s commit=%-9s delta_review=%-22s %s" % (
        b["id"], (b["commit"] or "-")[:8], b["delta_review"], "ok" if good else "NOT DONE"))
    if not good:
        blockers.append("batch %s is not both reviewed-pass and committed" % b["id"])

open_f = [f["id"] for f in snap["findings"] if f["disposition"] == "open"]
print("open findings:", " ".join(open_f) or "(none)")
if open_f:
    blockers.append("findings still open: " + " ".join(open_f))

live = [a for a in snap["approvals"] if a["revoked"] is None and a["scope"] == "plan"]
print("standing plan approval on the current hash:", bool(live))
if not live:
    blockers.append("no standing plan approval on the current plan hash")

# A re-review leaves no event, so the evidence is the envelope: complete, that
# role, hashing the CURRENT plan file. `want` can be None (plan file absent)
# and an envelope input's sha256 can be null (a legacy resumed invocation
# whose start hash is unknowable) — neither may count as evidence, or
# None == None marks a role evidenced by an envelope that proved nothing.
plan_path = snap["plan"]["path"]
want = (hashlib.sha256(open(plan_path, "rb").read()).hexdigest()
        if plan_path and os.path.exists(plan_path) else None)
ran = set()
# Both layouts: <role>/ (no run id) and <run-id>/<role>/ (runner --run-id).
for path in sorted(glob.glob(os.path.join(runner_state, "*", "*.envelope.json"))
                   + glob.glob(os.path.join(runner_state, "*", "*", "*.envelope.json"))):
    env = json.load(open(path))
    if (want is not None and env["status"] == "complete"
            and any(i.get("sha256") is not None and i["sha256"] == want
                    for i in env["inputs"])):
        ran.add(env["role"])
declared = [r for a in snap["plan"]["amendments"] for r in a["required_review"]]
print("declared re-reviews:", declared or "(none)", "| evidenced:", sorted(ran) or "(none)")
for role in sorted(set(declared)):
    if role not in ran:
        blockers.append("declared re-review %r has no complete envelope against the current plan" % role)

owned = sorted({p for b in snap["batches"] for p in b["owned_paths"]})
if owned:
    left = subprocess.check_output(
        ["git", "status", "--porcelain", "--untracked-files=all", "--"] + owned).decode().strip()
    print("owned paths uncommitted:", left.replace("\n", " | ") or "(none)")
    if left:
        blockers.append("owned paths still uncommitted: " + left.replace("\n", " | "))

for b in blockers:
    print("BLOCKER:", b)
print("BUILD COMPLETE" if not blockers else "NOT DONE — %d blocker(s)" % len(blockers))
PY
```

That script checks four of the five criteria below and prints `BUILD COMPLETE`
only when none of them is outstanding. Do not read the pass line as an answer to
criterion 5, which it cannot see.

1. Every batch in the plan's Batches table has been opened, and every batch in
   the manifest has a `commit` and a passing `delta_review`. *(Checked — pass the
   planned ids.)*
2. No finding is `open`. *(Checked.)*
3. A plan approval stands on the current hash, and every re-review an amendment
   declared has actually been run. *(Both checked.)* No event records "a review
   happened", so the evidence for the second is the envelope on disk: a
   `complete` one, in that role, whose inputs hash the **current** plan file — an
   amendment moves that hash, so a round run before it cannot satisfy the round
   it demanded. `CLODEX_RUNNER_STATE_DIR` overrides where the runner keeps those
   envelopes, so the check reads it rather than assuming `.clodex/runner`, and
   Python does the globbing so an unmatched pattern behaves the same in every
   shell. An `implementer` role appearing in `evidenced` is expected — §6 passes
   the plan as an input too — and it satisfies nothing but itself.
4. No owned path is left uncommitted. *(Checked, over the union of every batch's
   owned paths.)* A plan file amended after its batch was committed is the usual
   culprit — it belongs to the remediation batch.
5. Every plan item is done **or** amended. **This one is yours**, read against
   the plan text: nothing in the manifest knows what the plan promised beyond the
   batch ids you passed in. An item you neither built nor amended is not an exit;
   it is §11.

**Reconcile telemetry** before you hand off: `python3 "$STATE" telemetry-sync
"$RUN_DIR" "$REPO/.clodex/runner"` (`clodex` → Telemetry). Every implementer
and review leg this stage ran must have its `codex` block in the log —
`duration_s` and `status` copied from the envelope, never estimated or
asserted. Attach each printed block to an append you still make; a block with
no carrier left surfaces again at verify's reconcile, so nothing is carried in
prose.

Then hand off the way the router does: invoke `clodex-verify` and give it the
absolute run directory — *"clodex-verify, run dir
`<repo>/.clodex/r-2026-08-11-a`"*. Tell it the branch you are on if §4 created
one, since the manifest does not record it.

Do not append `stage:verify:entered`. Each stage appends its own entry event.

Carry nothing else forward in prose. If a fact matters to verify, it is in the
plan file, a commit, or the log — or it does not exist.

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Instead |
|---|---|
| Writing the changelog, bumping the version, or tagging "while the context is fresh" | All three are `clodex-ship`'s, always (§2). A plan that assigns them to a batch is a plan to amend. |
| `git add -A`, `git add .`, or `git commit -a` | Stage the batch's owned paths by name (§9). The tree holds other people's work and one flag sweeps it in. |
| A bare `git commit -m` after staging correctly | It commits the **whole index**, including anything the user staged before the run. Name the owned paths on the commit as well (§10). |
| Staging or committing `.clodex/profile.json` | This stage never edits, stages, or commits the profile. `git add` takes the whole file, including an edit that is not yours. |
| Opening the next batch with the current one unreviewed or uncommitted | One batch at a time; the verdict and the commit come first (§9, §12). |
| Reusing a batch id to redo work | Refused: *"batch 1 is already open"*. Redone work is a new batch with a new contract (§11). |
| Treating the implementer's `complete` as "the code is right" | `complete` means it finished its assignment. §7, §8, and §9 decide whether the work is right. |
| Reading the implementer's status out of its prose or stderr | The runner's exit code and the envelope decide. A `partial` is resumed, not restarted (§6). |
| Widening owned paths because the work "obviously" needs one more file | That is a scope change: amend (§11). The plan is the thing that got approved. |
| Amending without re-approving, because the change was small | Every amendment revokes every approval bound to the old hash — the plan approval included. There is no amendment that costs nothing (§11). |
| Handing back to `clodex-plan` to fix the plan | Refused: *"stage would move backwards, build -> plan"*. Build runs the amendment itself. |
| Reverting or stashing a dirty file that was not yours | Acknowledged dirt is left exactly as it is (§7). Only the user moves their own work. |
| Treating a `dirty_at_start` entry as a file path | It may be a directory, and then every file inside it is acknowledged and every owned path inside it overlaps. §3 expands and tests both directions; §7 resolves ancestors. Comparing with `==` or `in` fails both ways at once — a silent commit of the user's file, and a false STOP on their WIP. |
| Using "not in `dirty_at_start`" as the guard before restoring a stray | A file inside an acknowledged directory is not in that list either, so the guard passes and the `mv` takes the user's work out of their tree. Restore only what §7's `boundary-check` printed as `STRAY` **and** the implementer's own record claims. |
| Running the boundary check against the at-open dirty snapshot | Stale within minutes beside a concurrent session — it misattributes their work to the implementer. §6 captures `batch-<N>.pre` before `batch:opened`; §7 always passes it as `--baseline`. |
| Recording `delta_review: "pass"` in a repo with no test command | `pass-no-test-command`, so verify and ship can see that nothing executed (§8). |
| Inventing an event name | The vocabulary is frozen at 23 names and the reducer refuses anything else. This stage appends eight of them (§0). Something the names do not cover is a **field** on one of them — the optional `preflight` and `codex` blocks, and `finding:recorded`'s `severity`/`summary`/`round`/`invocation`/`plan_hash` (`clodex` → Telemetry). |
