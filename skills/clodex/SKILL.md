name: clodex
description: Use when any development work starts in a repository — a feature request, a dense brief, a bug fix, "continue where we left off", or an ask whose shape is unclear. Also use when a repo has a .clodex/ directory with an unfinished run, and before invoking clodex-plan, clodex-build, clodex-verify, or clodex-ship.

# clodex — the front door

## Overview

One entry point for all work, so nobody has to remember stage names. This skill
runs five things in order and then hands off:

1. **Preflight** — prove the environment before a stage burns tokens on it.
2. **Open-run detection** — a run already in flight is resumed, never
   overwritten.
3. **Profile** — load `.clodex/profile.json`, or interview once and write it.
4. **Lane classification** — feature-shaped work enters the core path; every
   other shape is named and handed back, because those lanes are v0.2.
5. **Change boundary** — record what was already dirty, and never let the run
   commit someone else's work.

Then it opens the run and hands to a stage skill.

This skill does not edit code, does not call Codex, and does not run release
actions. The stage skills own all three.

## Paths and commands

```bash
CLODEX_HOME="${CLODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.claude/skills/clodex}"  # the dir holding this SKILL.md
STATE="$CLODEX_HOME/state/clodex_state.py"
REPO="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
cd "$REPO"    # do this, do not just assume it
REMOTE="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref '@{upstream}' 2>/dev/null | cut -d/ -f1 || true)"
[ -n "$REMOTE" ] || REMOTE="$(git remote | head -1)"   # empty = this repo has no remote
```

Shell variables do not survive between separate command invocations, so
**re-establish this block at the top of any shell you run these procedures in**.
Later sections use `$REPO`, `$STATE`, and `$REMOTE` as if it were already there.

**Every command below runs from `$REPO`.** `git check-ignore`, the repo
inspection in §3, and `git add` all resolve relative paths against the current
directory, so from a subdirectory they answer the wrong question — a correct
`.gitignore` reads as missing. If a step cannot `cd`, use `git -C "$REPO" …`.

| Thing | Path | Committed? |
|---|---|---|
| Run-state engine | `$STATE` | catalogue |
| Profile schema | `$CLODEX_HOME/profile.schema.json` | catalogue |
| Codex runner (stages only, never here) | `$CLODEX_HOME/runner/run-codex.sh` | catalogue |
| Repo profile | `$REPO/.clodex/profile.json` | **yes** |
| Run directory | `$REPO/.clodex/<run-id>/` (`$RUN_DIR` below) | **no — gitignored** |

A run's state is its directory: `events.ndjson` is an append-only event log and
is **the** record of what happened; `run.json` is a snapshot derived from it by
replaying the log; `lock.json` says which session owns the run; `write.lock`
serializes writes and is not something you reason about. You add to a run only
by appending an event.

Engine commands (payloads travel on **stdin**, never argv):

```bash
python3 "$STATE" status  "$RUN_DIR"          # human summary, incl. the lock line
python3 "$STATE" rebuild "$RUN_DIR"          # full snapshot JSON
python3 "$STATE" append  "$RUN_DIR" < event.json
python3 "$STATE" unlock  "$RUN_DIR"          # dead holder only; refuses a live one
```

`append` exit codes: `0` written · `1` refused, nothing written, safe to retry ·
`2` usage · `3` the event is durably logged but `run.json` is stale. On `3` the
event **counts** — it is in the log and the reducer applies it — so **do not
retry** (that would double-write). Run `rebuild` to refresh the snapshot and
carry on from the event you just appended.

### Telemetry: two fields any event may carry

The vocabulary is frozen at 23 names, so what happened *around* an event is
recorded as fields on it rather than as events of its own. Both are optional;
a run that never sets them reduces exactly as it would have without them.

- **`preflight`** — `{"status": …, "checks": [{"name", "status", "detail"}]}`.
  Appended to the snapshot's `preflight` list. §1 explains when.
- **`codex`** — one **leg** of a Codex role invocation:
  ```json
  {"codex": {"invocation_id": "plan-reviewer-20260811T134400Z-88b056",
             "role": "plan-reviewer", "round": 4, "status": "complete",
             "envelope": ".clodex/runner/<run-id>/plan-reviewer/<id>.envelope.json",
             "input_hashes": ["<sha256 of each artifact it read>"],
             "duration_s": 501, "resumed": false}}
  ```
  `invocation_id` and `role` are required — a record nothing can be matched to
  would read as evidence that a round happened. Everything comes off the
  envelope the runner already wrote; `input_hashes` is what binds a review to
  the plan version it actually read.

  **A leg, not an invocation.** A resumed round overwrites its own envelope,
  which then reports only the resume — the pilot's envelopes under-reported the
  review by 25% that way. So append one `codex` block for the interrupted leg
  (`"status": "interrupted"`) and another for the resume (`"resumed": true`),
  both with the same `invocation_id`. The legs sum to what the round cost.

Attach a `codex` block to the first event that invocation causes — the finding
it raised, the `batch:reviewed` it produced, the `plan:amended` it forced. A
round that found nothing still gets one: put it on the event its clean result
unlocked (`plan:approved`, `batch:reviewed`), or the log cannot tell "reviewed
clean" from "never reviewed".

**Copied, never estimated.** `duration_s` is the envelope's `exit.duration_ms`
over 1000, and `status` is the envelope's `status` — never a number you
remember, never a state you assert. Estimated durations ran 1.1–1.8× actuals
the first weekend this was tested at scale, and two logs contradicted their
envelopes' status outright. And because the attach discipline itself fails
under load — seven completed invocations went unrecorded that same weekend —
every stage reconciles at its exit step:

```bash
python3 "$STATE" telemetry-sync "$RUN_DIR" "$REPO/.clodex/runner"
```

Exit 1 means it printed one ready-to-attach `codex` block per orphaned
envelope, every field copied from disk. Attach each block to an event that
stage still appends — any event carries one `codex` block. The diff is
recomputable, so a block with no carrier left is not hand-carried in prose: it
surfaces again at the next stage's reconcile, whose own appends can carry it.

`finding:recorded` additionally takes `severity`, `summary`, `location`,
`detail`, `recommendation`, `round`, `invocation` and `plan_hash` — `location`
and `detail` copied verbatim from the envelope's finding, so the manifest can
answer *where* and *why* without anyone opening envelopes — and
`finding:disposed`'s `note` is promoted into the snapshot beside them. See
`clodex-plan` §9.

### Long rounds: `--detach`, and how to watch one

A review or implementer round can outlive a harness tool timeout. Do not
babysit it in the foreground and do not hand-roll nohup — the runner does it:

```bash
bash "$RUNNER" --role implementer --repo "$REPO" \
     --run-id "$(basename "$RUN_DIR")" --prompt-file "$PROMPT" --detach
# -> detached <invocation-id> pid <pid> log <runner log path>
```

Watch **both** signals, because either alone lies: the pid (gone means the
run ended, says nothing about how) and the runner log's final status line —
`grep -E '^(complete|partial|interrupted|failed) ' <log>` — which also names
the envelope. Heartbeats stream into the same log, so a stalled run and a
slow one are distinguishable mid-flight. When the pid is gone, map the status
the way the stage skills' rc tables do. `--resume <invocation-id>` works
alone: the runner recorded the prompt path in the invocation's meta.

Stage skills always pass `--run-id "$(basename "$RUN_DIR")"`. It keys the
runner state by run (`.clodex/runner/<run-id>/<role>/…`), so two runs in one
repo never interleave their envelopes.

---

## 1. Preflight — before any stage runs

Run every check. A failed check stops here; do not "proceed and see." Report the
results in chat **and carry them into the run**: the `run:opened` event in §6
takes a `preflight` field holding every check's verdict, so "was this
environment ever verified?" is answerable from the manifest instead of from a
transcript. Preflight that runs again — on a resume, or after the user fixes a
failed check — rides on whatever event you append next, and appends a second
record rather than replacing the first.

A run that is resumed rather than opened has no `run:opened` to carry it: put
the `preflight` field on the `stage:*:entered` event the stage skill appends,
which is the first event of the resumed session.

**When a check fails**, the invocation does not end: name the check, say exactly
what would fix it, and wait for the user. When they say it is fixed, **resume
from that check** — re-run it and continue down the list. Do not silently re-run
the checks that already passed, and do not skip the ones after it.

**Order on a first run:** checks 4, 6, and 7 read the profile, which does not
exist yet. Do checks 1–3 and 5, run the interview (§3), then come back and
finish 4, 6, and 7. Check 7 also self-defers when the profile is missing. A
first run also has no `.clodex/` directory, so §2 finds nothing and costs one
`ls`.

1. **Repo root.** `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`. Not inside a work tree → stop
   and ask where the work lives. Also note the branch: `git rev-parse
   --abbrev-ref HEAD`.
2. **Remote state.** `$REMOTE` comes from the preamble — the remote is not
   always named `origin`, and halting a workflow over a hardcoded name is a
   self-inflicted outage:
   ```bash
   if [ -n "$REMOTE" ]; then
     git ls-remote --exit-code "$REMOTE" HEAD >/dev/null
   else
     echo "no remote configured"
   fi
   git status -sb | head -1                       # ahead/behind
   ```
   `ls-remote` proves the remote is reachable *and* that credentials work.
   Report divergence now — a repo behind its remote gets resolved before
   planning, never at ship. "No remote configured" is a **pass**, not a failure:
   say so out loud, because ship will have no push step.
3. **`.clodex/` ignore rule.** Run state must never be committed; the profile
   must be:
   ```bash
   git check-ignore -q .clodex/ANY-RUN-ID/events.ndjson  # expect exit 0 (ignored)
   git check-ignore -q .clodex/profile.json              # expect exit 1 (NOT ignored)
   ```
   `check-ignore` tests the path against the ignore rules, so neither path has to
   exist and `ANY-RUN-ID` is a stand-in, not a reserved name. Exit 1 on the
   second probe is the **pass**, not an error — run them as two separate commands
   so a shell with `set -e` cannot swallow the result.
   Either result wrong → the remedy is the **nested ignore file**,
   `.clodex/.gitignore`, self-contained inside the directory it governs so no
   other session's edit to the shared `.gitignore` can collide with it (that
   collision once nearly swept 56 events into someone else's commit):
   ```
   *
   !.gitignore
   !profile.json
   !claims.json
   ```
   The `!.gitignore` line lets the file exempt itself; without it the remedy
   ignores its own carrier. `claims.json` is the shared-claims ledger (check
   8) — committed state like the profile, so it gets the same negation (for a
   root-style remedy: `!.clodex/claims.json`). Show the user, write it after they agree, and make
   sure it gets **committed** (§3 step 4 commits it beside the profile) — an
   uncommitted nested file does not exist in a fresh worktree, which is exactly
   where run state most needs ignoring. Root-`.gitignore` lines (`.clodex/*` +
   `!.clodex/profile.json`) remain a legal remedy where a repo already has
   them; do not migrate a working one.

   **Second ignore mechanisms replace `.gitignore` — probe every one present.**
   `.gcloudignore`, `.dockerignore`, `.vercelignore`, `.npmignore`: each makes
   its uploader ignore *its* list instead of git's, so a repo whose git ignore
   is perfect can still ship run state — sixteen worktrees of clodex logs and
   evidence screenshots once entered a production Cloud Build upload exactly
   this way. For each such file that exists:
   ```bash
   for f in .gcloudignore .dockerignore .vercelignore .npmignore; do
     [ -f "$f" ] && { grep -qE '(^|/)\.clodex(/|$)|^\.clodex\b' "$f" \
       || echo "$f does not exclude .clodex/ — run state will ride its uploads"; }
   done
   ```
   A miss is handled the way this check handles `.gitignore`: show the exact
   lines to add (`.clodex/` — plus `worktrees/` when lanes live under the
   repo), and write them only after the user agrees.
4. **Runtimes.** For each entry in the profile's `runtimes`: `command -v
   <command>`, plus the version check when `min_version` is set. Missing runtime
   → stop; it fails later and more expensively inside a stage. An empty list is
   a legal answer (this repo pins no runtimes); a *missing* `runtimes` key is a
   profile that never answered the question — go fix it in §3.

   **In a worktree, a missing prerequisite gets an offer — never an auto-run,
   never a shrug.** The profile's `commands.install` is required by the
   schema, filled at the interview, and executed by nothing — while every
   lane rediscovers the same folklore (symlinked env files, a venv built from
   the parent checkout) by hand. When this check, or a dry probe of the test
   command, shows dependencies, a venv, or an env file absent in a worktree:
   **offer** to run `commands.install`, and offer to materialize the env
   files the main checkout carries (symlink or copy; the user names which
   files, and their contents are never read or printed). Run either only
   after the user says yes. Preflight's charter stays proof, not
   construction — the offer is the construction path, and it is theirs to
   take.
5. **Codex auth.** `command -v codex`, then `codex login status` (expect exit 0
   and a logged-in line). Codex is not optional: plan review is default-on and
   build delegates to it. Not logged in → stop and ask the user to run
   `codex login`.
6. **Credentials.** For each name in the profile's `required_env`:
   ```bash
   printenv "$NAME" >/dev/null || echo "missing credential: $NAME"
   ```
   Names only. Never print, echo, log, or write a credential value.
7. **Bootstrap currency.** Every checkout runs the bootstrap currency check:
   ```bash
   python3 "$CLODEX_HOME/state/bootstrap_check.py" "$REPO" "$CLODEX_HOME"
   ```
   It answers the six bootstrap questions in order, one line each: a missing
   profile is `first-run — defer to §3`; a schema-version mismatch (or a
   profile that is not loadable JSON) is `re-derive`; a clodex minor-version
   mismatch, a fingerprint mismatch, and an incomplete, missing, or
   unknown-key bootstrap are each `recorded` in **every** checkout, never
   enforced (Johnny's 2026-09-02 ruling — the re-derive tax scaled by repos ×
   releases outweighed its value); and a linked-worktree profile that is not
   tracked is `stop`. A current profile passes with exit 0, and so does one
   carrying only recorded currency drift. The only two hard stops left are a
   structurally unusable profile (schema/JSON) and that untracked-worktree
   profile.

   When this checkout is a linked
   worktree — `git rev-parse --git-dir` differs from `git rev-parse
   --git-common-dir` — first-run setup must already be **committed**, never
   re-created here:
   ```bash
   git ls-files --error-unmatch .clodex/profile.json   # expect exit 0 (tracked)
   ```
   Tracked → record `{"name": "bootstrap", "status": "pass"}` among the
   preflight checks. Not tracked → **stop; a lane never interviews.** Two
   lanes once interviewed independently, six minutes apart, produced
   contradictory profiles, and merge order silently picked the winner — every
   later lane inherited answers nobody chose. The fix is the bootstrap ritual
   (§3), run once from the main checkout on the default branch before lanes
   fork; tell the user that, and wait. In the main checkout the tracked-file
   probe alone is skipped — every currency question above still runs there and
   prints its verdict, but currency drift only ever `recorded`s; the sole
   verdict the main checkout still enforces is `contract-moved` (schema/JSON).
8. **Claims (when `.clodex/claims.json` exists).** The shared-claims ledger:
   collision-prone resources — migration numbers, ports, workflow ids,
   property names — claimed for the repo's concurrent lanes. **Orchestrator-
   owned: only the orchestrator writes or commits it; lanes read.** Shape:
   ```json
   {"claims": [{"resource": "migration-008", "holder": "lane-C",
                "note": "room-liveness schema"}]}
   ```
   Check every resource this run will need — the brief usually names them,
   and the plan's `Claims:` line (clodex-plan §5) re-checks at plan time:
   ```bash
   python3 - "$REPO/.clodex/claims.json" <needed resource>... <<'PY'
   import json, sys
   path, needed = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2:]
   try:
       held = {c["resource"]: c for c in json.load(open(path)).get("claims", [])}
   except FileNotFoundError:
       print("no claims ledger"); raise SystemExit(0)
   rc = 0
   for r in needed:
       c = held.get(r)
       if c and c.get("holder"):
           print("CLAIMED: %s is held by %s%s" % (r, c["holder"],
                 " — " + c["note"] if c.get("note") else ""))
           rc = 1
       else:
           print("free:", r)
   raise SystemExit(rc)
   PY
   ```
   A `CLAIMED` hit **fails the lane here** — three lanes once independently
   claimed the same migration number, and only the orchestrator's hand
   arbitration caught it at merge. The fix is theirs: renumber, or get the
   orchestrator to reassign the claim and commit the ledger. Never edit
   `claims.json` from a lane, even to claim for yourself — a lane has no
   commit authority over shared coordination state.

   **Waiting on a sibling lane** is the same read-only discipline: the
   sanctioned recipe is a Monitor polling
   `git ls-tree <default-branch> -- <the path the sibling will land>` until
   it appears — no new event, no shared mutable state, and the poll answers
   from committed truth rather than from another lane's promises.

---

## 2. Is a run already open?

```bash
ls -1d "$REPO"/.clodex/r-*/ 2>/dev/null
python3 "$STATE" status "$REPO/.clodex/<run-id>"
```

A run is **open** when `status` shows a `stage:` other than `closed`.

`stage: -` is not an open run — it is a directory that never got its
`run:opened` event, left by a session that died in the window §6 opens between
`mkdir` and the first append. It has no brief, lane, or start commit, so there
is nothing to resume. Close it out and open a new run:
`echo '{"e":"run:closed"}' | python3 "$STATE" append "$RUN_DIR"` (legal on an
empty log; it yields `stage: closed`).

**One open run per *checkout*.** A linked worktree is its own checkout with
its own `.clodex/`, which is what lets parallel lanes each carry a run — a
documented feature, not an accident of `--show-toplevel`. Within one checkout:
if you find two open runs, the older is the one whose run id sorts first —
the ids are `r-<date>-<letter>`, so plain lexicographic order is
chronological. Resume it, or close it with the same `run:closed` append,
before opening anything new. The **repo-wide** picture — every run in the
main checkout and every worktree — is the index, not a rule:

```bash
python3 "$STATE" runs "<main-checkout>"
```

One line per run: path, stage, open findings, release state. It replaces the
shell loop every orchestrator otherwise hand-rolls over `worktrees/*/`.

`status` also prints a `lock:` line when `lock.json` exists. That line decides
what you may do:

| `status` shows | What it means | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| no `lock:` line | no write is in flight and no writer died mid-write | Offer resume (below); an `append` will be accepted. This is the *normal* state even while another session is working, because the lock is taken per write and released — so a missing lock line is not proof you are alone. The one-open-run rule and the user's answer to the resume offer are what actually keep two agents off one run. |
| `lock: held by pid N (not running) since …` | a session died mid-write | Offer resume-or-abort. On resume: `python3 "$STATE" unlock "$RUN_DIR"` — plain `unlock` succeeds only for a dead holder, which is exactly this case — then resume. Never `--force` here. |
| `lock: … (running)` or `… (liveness unknown)` | another session owns the run, or a write is in flight right now. *Unknown* means the lock carries no usable PID — including a lock caught in the instant between its creation and its payload write, whose holder is very much alive | **Do not write.** Name the PID to the user. `unlock` will refuse. Only after the user confirms that process is gone may you run `unlock --force`. Otherwise abort here and let the other session finish. |

**Who may write run state while the lock is held:** only the holder, plus
processes the holder spawned carrying the `CLODEX_LOCK_TOKEN` environment
variable, which the engine exports to its children so they can write as the same
owner. Every other session's `append` is refused — exit 1, nothing written. You
never create or hand-edit `lock.json`, and there is no `acquire` verb: the engine
takes the session lock around each write itself. A dead holder's lock is **never**
broken implicitly; breaking it is this skill's decision, made with the user.

**The resume offer.** From `status` (and `rebuild` for fields `status` does not
print, such as `brief`), tell the user in one message: the run id and lane, the
brief, the current stage, plan version and amendment count, open findings,
verification debt, release state and any pending step. Then offer these three —
**and lead with the one the situation calls for, not always Resume**:

- **Close** → append `{"e": "run:closed"}`. Lead with this, and say plainly that
  it is the answer, whenever the run reached you as a **hand-back from a stage
  skill asking for closure** — `clodex-verify` does that when verification
  fails, so a follow-on run can carry this run's id as its `parent` (§6). Such a
  run is still open at its stage, so offering Resume first walks the user
  straight back into the loop the hand-back exists to escape. Follow the
  handing-back skill's stated procedure; do not improvise a substitute here.
- **Resume** → hand to the stage skill for the current stage (§6 table). If
  `release:` shows a pending step, do **not** retry it here: clodex-ship
  reconciles pending steps against reality before any retry.
- **Abandon** → append `{"e": "release:updated", "state": "abandoned"}`, then
  `{"e": "run:closed"}`.

**Archive on close — every close path, this skill's and ship's.** A run that
lives in a worktree keeps its evidence, envelopes and handoff artifact in a
directory that dies with `git worktree remove`; a release record pointing into
one points at deletable paths. So whenever a run closes in a checkout that is
not the main one, copy the core across — archived into an ignored path, never
committed, so no commit-authority question arises:

```bash
python3 - "$STATE" "$RUN_DIR" <<'PY'
import json, os, shutil, subprocess, sys
state, run_dir = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
snap = json.loads(subprocess.check_output(["python3", state, "rebuild", run_dir]))
repo = snap["repo"]
head = subprocess.check_output(["git", "-C", repo, "worktree", "list", "--porcelain"]).decode()
main = head.splitlines()[0].split(" ", 1)[1]          # first entry is the main checkout
if os.path.realpath(main) == os.path.realpath(repo):
    print("main checkout — run state is already as durable as it gets; nothing to do")
    raise SystemExit(0)
dest = os.path.join(main, ".clodex", "archive", os.path.basename(os.path.normpath(run_dir)))
os.makedirs(dest, exist_ok=True)
copied = 0
for name in sorted(os.listdir(run_dir)):              # the run dir IS the core:
    src = os.path.join(run_dir, name)                 # log, snapshot, prompts, diffs,
    out = os.path.join(dest, name)                    # gate logs, evidence, handoff
    if os.path.isfile(src):
        shutil.copy2(src, out); copied += 1
    elif os.path.isdir(src):
        shutil.copytree(src, out, dirs_exist_ok=True); copied += 1
# Envelopes are selected by the MANIFEST, not by globbing: invocations[] names
# exactly the legs this run spent, and their envelopes are the only place
# finding location/detail exist once the worktree is gone.
for leg in snap.get("invocations") or []:
    env = leg.get("envelope")
    if not env:
        continue
    src = env if os.path.isabs(env) else os.path.join(repo, env)
    if not os.path.isfile(src):
        print("MISSING envelope (recorded but not on disk):", env)
        continue
    out = os.path.join(dest, "runner", os.path.basename(os.path.dirname(src)),
                       os.path.basename(src))
    os.makedirs(os.path.dirname(out), exist_ok=True)
    shutil.copy2(src, out); copied += 1
print("archived %d item(s) -> %s" % (copied, dest))
PY
```

Raw runner transcripts (`*.events.ndjson` under `.clodex/runner/`) are
deliberately not copied — they are an order of magnitude bigger than
everything else combined, and the envelopes carry what the record needs.

Never delete a run directory to get out of this. The log is the record of what
happened.

---

## 3. Profile — load, or interview once

`$REPO/.clodex/profile.json` is committed state: it is how a repo tells clodex
how to build, test, version, release, and verify itself.

**It exists** → load it and validate it:

```bash
python3 - "$CLODEX_HOME" "$REPO" <<'PY'
import importlib.util, json, os, sys
home, repo = sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2]
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location(
    "clodex_state", os.path.join(home, "state", "clodex_state.py"))
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
mod.validate(json.load(open(os.path.join(repo, ".clodex", "profile.json"))),
             json.load(open(os.path.join(home, "profile.schema.json"))))
print("profile ok")
PY
```

On success that prints `profile ok` and exits 0. On failure it exits 1 with a
traceback whose **last line names the offending path** — e.g.
`ClodexStateError: $.actions[0].policy: 'auto' is not an allowed value`. Report
that path and message to the user verbatim; it is the fastest fix instruction
there is.

It checks types, required fields, and enums. It does **not** check
`additionalProperties`, `pattern`, or `minItems` — so an unknown key, a
malformed action id, and an action with an empty `argv` all survive it. Read the
file yourself as well.

The profile step has one shared re-derive procedure with two entry points:
**first-run** when the profile does not exist, and **re-derive** when check 7
reports `contract-moved` (a schema-version mismatch or an unloadable profile).
Skill-version, fingerprint, and bootstrap-block drift are recorded by check 7,
not enforced, so they no longer trigger this procedure — re-derive those by
hand only if you want to. First-run and re-derive are the same
procedure; first-run compares inspected reality with nothing, while re-derive
compares it with the recorded profile. Never partially repair only a few keys,
and never re-derive from a lane.

1. **Inspect before asking.** Anything you can read, do not ask about. Run the
   full probe from the repository root:
   ```bash
   python3 "$CLODEX_HOME/state/inspect_repo.py" "$REPO"
   ```
   Use the emitted inspection artifact and bootstrap values for the next steps.
   Print the field-by-field diff of inspected reality versus the recorded
   profile (first run: versus nothing). Ask only about disagreements and newly
   required fields, in one message. Preserve everything inspection cannot
   settle — the branch rule, tag format, actions, and `notes`.
   Fill in `runtimes` and `commands.install` from the inspection; the probe's
   "interview aids" section carries the values the markers alone do not — pin
   file contents, recent tags, the default branch, the package version — so
   these fields come from reading, not asking. `package.json` `engines`,
   `.nvmrc`, `.tool-versions`, and `pyproject.toml` `requires-python` give you
   `command` and `min_version` without asking anyone.

2. **Ask once, in one message.** On a FIRST RUN that message confirms the full
   set below. On a RE-DERIVE it contains only step 1's disagreements and newly
   required fields — a settled decision the diff does not contradict (branch
   rule, tag format, actions, deploy, evidence defaults) is preserved
   silently, never re-opened; a routine currency re-derive that re-interviews
   the whole profile is this procedure done wrong. The full first-run set:
   confirm the build/test/lint/typecheck commands
   (`null` where the repo genuinely has none — an omitted gate gets silently
   skipped at verify) and the runtimes you inferred; version source; branch rule
   and tag format; changelog path; architecture docs and where plans go; deploy
   target and the exact command that proves a release is live; default evidence
   classes; which release actions clodex may take; the **names** of required env
   vars.

   What those terms mean, so you can answer "what are my options?":
   - **Version source** — the file that holds the authoritative version, and the
     key inside it. Typically `package.json` → `version`, or `pyproject.toml` →
     `project.version`, or a bare `VERSION` file. `null` if the repo is
     unversioned.
   - **Branch rule** — whether a run may commit straight to the default branch
     (`main`, `work_on_default: true`) or must work on its own branch
     (`work_on_default: false` plus a naming pattern like `feature/<slug>` or
     `clodex/<run-id>`).
   - **Tag format** — the pattern a release tag follows, e.g. `v{version}`
     producing `v1.4.0`; or tagging off entirely (`enabled: false`).
   - **Deploy target** — where a release actually lands and how it gets there:
     a host and project auto-deploying on push to the default branch, a manual
     command listed in `actions`, something external, or nothing at all
     (`deploy: null` — ship then closes at an explicit not-deployed boundary).
   - **Evidence classes** — the five kinds of proof a plan can require;
     `evidence.default_classes` is which of them this repo expects by default:
     `tests` (automated suites), `real-data` (run against production-shaped
     input), `live-check` (the deployed thing observed working), `visual`
     (rendered output reviewed), `client-artifact` (the artifact a client
     receives, read from their side). `clodex-plan` owns the per-plan detail.
3. **Action policy is structured, per action.** Every entry in `actions` carries
   a literal `argv` and a `policy`:
   - `auto-with-authorization` — may run once it is covered by the single
     consolidated release authorization: the one message in which `clodex-ship`
     enumerates every external action a release will take and the user approves
     the set.
   - `always-ask-exact` — the literal filled argv is presented for approval
     **every time, in every run**. Use this for destructive or irreversible
     actions, and for repos with their own guardrail tiers (an infra control
     plane marks its red-tier actions this way).

   Unsure → `always-ask-exact`. Nothing outside `actions` may be proposed at
   ship; a new action gets added to the profile and committed first. A complete
   entry — `{braced}` placeholders are filled from run state before the argv is
   shown or run:
   ```json
   {"id": "push-main",
    "argv": ["git", "push", "origin", "main"],
    "cwd": null,
    "target": "origin/main",
    "env_refs": [],
    "policy": "auto-with-authorization"}
   ```
   The remaining three fields: `cwd` is the repo-relative directory the command
   runs in, `null` meaning the repo root; `target` names what the action affects
   in plain words, so a user approving it can see the blast radius without
   parsing argv; `env_refs` lists the **names** of credentials the action needs,
   never values, and `[]` when it needs none. The same repo would mark a
   production deploy `always-ask-exact`, so its literal filled argv is shown for
   approval on every release.
4. **Write, validate, commit.** Write every required key and include the
   `bootstrap` block emitted by `inspect_repo.py`, setting
   `clodex_version` from `$CLODEX_HOME/VERSION` — the schema requires
   `runtimes` and `required_env` (use `[]` for "none", never omit them) and every
   key of `commands` including `install`, precisely so preflight checks 4 and 6
   have something to check. Re-run the validator above, then commit **by
   pathspec**, because the tree — and the index — may hold the user's unrelated
   work:
   ```bash
   git add .clodex/profile.json && git commit -m "chore(clodex): repo profile" -- .clodex/profile.json
   ```
   The trailing `-- .clodex/profile.json` is the load-bearing part. A bare
   `git commit -m` commits **everything already staged**, so anything the user or
   another tool had in the index rides along inside a commit labelled as a
   profile write. With the pathspec, the commit can hold only that one file and
   the rest of the index is left exactly as it was. The `git add` is still
   required — a pathspec cannot name a file git does not yet know about. When
   §1 check 3 wrote the nested `.clodex/.gitignore`, name it in **both** lists
   — it must be committed for worktrees to inherit it.

   This is the only commit this skill makes. Never `git add -A`, `git add .`, or
   `git commit -a`. Ever.
5. **`notes` is inert.** It is free-form text for humans and nothing in clodex
   reads it. Anything that must change what clodex *does* goes in a typed field.

Field-by-field contract: `$CLODEX_HOME/profile.schema.json`.

### Bootstrap — multi-lane repos: once, before lanes fork

A repo that will run parallel lanes in worktrees gets the shared first-run or
re-derive procedure's resulting setup as **one commit, on the default branch,
from the main checkout, before any lane forks**: the profile with its emitted
`bootstrap` block and the nested `.clodex/.gitignore` (§1 check 3). The router
never checks branches out — when the main checkout is not on the default
branch, the commit is the user's to make there (or via `git -C
<main-checkout>` once it is), and the bootstrap waits until it exists. Once the
bootstrap commit exists, every lane's preflight **requires** it (§1 check 7)
and no lane ever interviews or re-derives. A repo whose lanes contend for
numbered or named resources also bootstraps the claims ledger — an empty
`{"claims": []}` in `.clodex/claims.json`, committed the same way; the
orchestrator alone writes to it thereafter (§1 check 8).

## 4. Classify the ask

| Shape | The ask looks like | Route |
|---|---|---|
| **feature** | new or changed behavior someone can observe — a capability, an enhancement, a behavior-changing bug fix | **core path** |
| **audit** | "review / inventory / assess X across the repo", no change requested yet | **core path** — open with `lane: "audit"`, hand to `clodex-audit` |
| repair | recovering a broken state — failed deploy, environment drift, corrupted data | lane not built |
| chore | mechanical, no product decision — dependency bumps, renames, formatting, test backfill, config sync | lane not built |
| sync | making two places agree — docs↔code, env↔env, fork↔upstream, inventory↔reality | lane not built |

**Feature-shaped** → continue to §5, open the run, hand to `clodex-plan`.

**Audit-shaped** → the same path with a different lane: §5, open the run with
`"lane": "audit"`, hand to `clodex-audit` (§6's table). The audit lane earned
its build with usage evidence — two manual audits in one weekend, both
excellent — and it is read-only by charter, so the change boundary it needs
is the acknowledgment, not an owned-path plan.

**Anything else** → the noticing rule. Say exactly three things and stop:

1. Name the shape: "This is chore-shaped work — a mechanical change with no
   product decision in it."
2. Say the lane is not built: "repair, chore, and sync are deferred; each
   enters only with usage evidence, the way audit's did."
3. Propose the closest manual approach, concretely — the actual commands, files,
   or sequence you would use, not a category.

Then **do not open a run.** There is no stage skill to drive those lanes,
and an open run nothing can advance is worse than none. If the user accepts the
manual approach, do that work as ordinary work: no run directory, no manifest,
no clodex events.

Mixed asks ("audit the config, then fix it") classify by what the user wants
*done*. An audit-then-fix ask runs the audit lane first; its report's Routing
section then feeds the fix into a feature run with the audit run as `parent`.
A fix that is already fully specified skips straight to the core path, with
the audit part folded into planning's grounding rather than run separately.

---

## 5. The change boundary

### A. At open — acknowledge what is already dirty

```bash
START_HEAD="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"                # recorded as git.start_head
git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all      # the dirty snapshot
```

`--untracked-files=all` (`-uall`) is not optional. Plain `git status --porcelain`
collapses an untracked directory into one entry — `?? docs/` — but everything
downstream treats `git.dirty_at_start` as a list of **files**, and a directory
entry breaks the change boundary in both directions. §5B asks whether a dirty
path *is* an owned path or sits under one, which an acknowledged **ancestor**
like `docs/` never satisfies: a batch owning `docs/plans/` sees no overlap, and
the user's pre-existing `docs/plans/older-draft.md` lands in the batch commit —
the exact outcome this section exists to prevent. Compared the other way, every
file under an acknowledged directory reads as an unowned stray and falsely
halts the run. `-uall` records the files themselves, so neither happens.

Record each entry as a **repo-relative file path with the status prefix
stripped**. Porcelain lines are `XY<space>path`, so take everything from the
fourth character on: ` M src/app.ts` → `src/app.ts`, `?? docs/plans/draft.md` →
`docs/plans/draft.md`. No status letters, no trailing slashes, no directories.
For a staged rename (`R  old -> new`) record the new path. A path containing a
space or a quote comes back C-quoted (`"a b.txt"`); if you hit one, re-run with
`-z` and split the NUL-separated output instead of unquoting by hand.

Show the user every dirty path. They acknowledge the list, or **the run does not
open**. The acknowledged paths go into `run:opened` as `git.dirty_at_start`
(§6). A clean tree records `[]`.

### B. Before build — when a dirty path overlaps an owned path

**Who runs this and when:** not the router. The router's pass ends at §6, and
owned paths do not exist yet at that point. `clodex-build` re-reads this section
**before opening its first batch**, comparing the plan's owned paths against
`git.dirty_at_start` in the run snapshot. Running it earlier does not work
mechanically either: the `approval:granted` event below binds to a plan hash, so
the reducer refuses it — exit 1, *"approval must bind to a plan hash; none given
and no plan is recorded"* — until `clodex-plan` has recorded a plan.

A **batch** is one bounded unit of implementation work with a declared list of
**owned paths** — the only paths that batch may touch. `clodex-plan` declares
them. A dirty path overlaps when it *is* an owned path or sits under one, which
is a sound test only because §A recorded files: if you find a directory entry in
`git.dirty_at_start` — an older run, or a hand-edited snapshot — expand it with
`git status --porcelain --untracked-files=all` before comparing, or an ancestor
entry will match nothing and let a pre-existing file through. There are exactly
**three legal outcomes**:

1. **Fold with acknowledgment.** The pre-existing edit will end up inside a
   clodex commit, so capture it into the run directory *first* and get the user
   to say so out loud:
   ```bash
   git diff -- <overlapping tracked paths> > "$RUN_DIR/pre-existing.diff"
   git diff --stat -- <overlapping tracked paths>          # show the user
   # untracked overlaps are absent from git diff — copy them instead:
   for f in <overlapping untracked paths>; do
     mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR/pre-existing/$(dirname "$f")"
     cp -p "$f" "$RUN_DIR/pre-existing/$f"
   done
   ```
   Then record the acknowledgment as an event (a plan is recorded by now, so the
   approval binds to it):
   ```json
   {"e": "approval:granted", "scope": "dirty-fold", "by": "user",
    "actions": [{"id": "fold-pre-existing", "paths": ["src/x/thing.ts"],
                 "captured": ".clodex/<run-id>/pre-existing.diff"}]}
   ```
2. **Isolate in a clean worktree.**
   ```bash
   git worktree add ../<repo>-clodex-<run-id> -b clodex/<run-id> "$START_HEAD"
   ```
   Re-run this skill from the worktree: fresh preflight, clean tree, new run. If
   a run was already open in the dirty checkout, close it (§2) and set the new
   run's `parent` to the closed run's id.
3. **Abort.** Do not open or continue the run. Tell the user what would unblock
   it — commit, stash, or move their work — and stop.

**Hard rules, no fourth option:**

- Path-level ownership never blurs file-level provenance. Owning `src/x/` does
  not entitle a commit to a pre-existing edit to `src/x/thing.ts`. That file is
  folded, isolated, or the run aborts.
- Never run `git add -A`, `git add .`, `git commit -a`, `git stash`, or
  `git checkout -- <path>` on the user's behalf.
- Ship stages only paths owned by the run's batches. Unrelated work in the tree
  is never swept into a clodex commit.

---

## 6. Open the run, then hand off

```bash
DATE="$(date -u +%Y-%m-%d)"
RUN_ID=""
for L in a b c d e f g h; do
  [ -e "$REPO/.clodex/r-$DATE-$L" ] && continue
  RUN_ID="r-$DATE-$L"; break                  # first free letter for today
done
if [ -z "$RUN_ID" ]; then
  RUN_DIR=""
  echo "no free run id for $DATE — stop, do not open a run"
else
  RUN_DIR="$REPO/.clodex/$RUN_ID"
  mkdir -p "$RUN_DIR"
fi
```

The guard is inside the block on purpose. An unguarded empty `$RUN_ID` makes
`$REPO/.clodex/$RUN_ID` expand to `$REPO/.clodex/` itself, and the append then
writes `events.ndjson` and `run.json` **beside `profile.json`**, where §2's
`ls -1d "$REPO"/.clodex/r-*/` will never find them. If you see that message,
**stop and tell the user**: eight runs in one day means something is wrong, and
appending into an existing run directory would corrupt someone else's history.

Write the event to `$RUN_DIR/run-opened.json` with your file-writing tool, not
shell interpolation — the brief is verbatim user text and will contain quotes:

```json
{"e": "run:opened",
 "run": "r-2026-08-10-b",
 "parent": null,
 "repo": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
 "branch": "main",
 "brief": "<the ask, verbatim>",
 "lane": "feature",
 "git": {"start_head": "<git rev-parse HEAD>",
         "dirty_at_start": ["src/app.ts", "docs/plans/older-draft.md"]},
 "preflight": {"status": "pass",
               "checks": [{"name": "repo-root", "status": "pass", "detail": "/absolute/path/to/repo, branch main"},
                          {"name": "remote", "status": "pass", "detail": "origin reachable, 0 ahead 0 behind"},
                          {"name": "clodex-ignore", "status": "pass", "detail": "run state ignored, profile tracked"},
                          {"name": "runtimes", "status": "pass", "detail": "node 22.4.0, python 3.12.2"},
                          {"name": "codex-auth", "status": "pass", "detail": "codex login status ok"},
                          {"name": "required-env", "status": "pass", "detail": "none required"}]}}
```

One check per §1 item, in §1's order, each with the verdict you reported in
chat. `status` is the verdict for the whole list — `pass` only when every check
passed. A check the user fixed mid-preflight is recorded at the verdict it
**ended** on, and `detail` says it was fixed, because the manifest's job is to
answer whether the environment was verified, not to relitigate how.

Two fields need a decision rather than a copy:

- **`parent`** is `null` for ordinary new work, but **not** when the ask reached
  you as a hand-back from a stage skill naming a prior run. A run cannot be sent
  backwards — stage order is monotonic — so a stage that needs earlier work
  redone closes its run and asks for a follow-on; `clodex-verify` does exactly
  this when verification fails. In that case `parent` is the closed run's id,
  copied verbatim from the hand-back sentence: `"parent": "r-2026-08-10-a"`. It
  is the only link between the two runs, so a `null` here silently orphans the
  history. The §5B worktree path is the same shape: the new run's `parent` is the
  run you closed in the dirty checkout.
- **`dirty_at_start`** is file paths only — never `"docs/"` — for the reasons in
  §5A.

```bash
python3 "$STATE" append "$RUN_DIR" < "$RUN_DIR/run-opened.json"   # stdin, never argv
rm -f "$RUN_DIR/run-opened.json"
```

The engine stamps `schema_version`, `seq`, and `t` — do not supply them. On a
non-zero exit, read the error on stderr and act on the exit codes above: `1`
covers a locked run, a bad payload, and a reducer invariant alike, and they need
different responses.

Then invoke the stage skill, telling it the absolute run directory — it reads
everything else from the run itself ("clodex-plan, run dir
`/absolute/path/to/repo/.clodex/r-2026-08-10-a`"):

| Stage in `status` | Hand to |
|---|---|
| `open` with `lane: audit` | `clodex-audit` (its stage stays `open` for the whole run — that is its shape, not a stall) |
| `open`, `plan` | `clodex-plan` |
| `build` | `clodex-build` |
| `verify` | `clodex-verify` |
| `ship` | `clodex-ship` |

The router does **not** append `stage:*:entered`. Each stage skill appends its
own entry event, so the log never claims a stage that did not start.

### Orchestrated lanes: the brief and report templates

`$CLODEX_HOME/templates/` carries the codified brief-and-report contract —
the part of a multi-lane weekend that demonstrably carried output quality
(the bare control lane matched the clodex lanes because its brief was equally
good; brief anatomy is the quality engine, and these files make it
reproducible):

- **`lane-brief.md`** — the 16-part anatomy. Use it when *writing* briefs for
  lanes, and hold an incoming brief against it when you receive one. Its two
  standing rules bind either way: the orchestration plan is committed before
  lanes fork, and every lane's report opens with its run id — or "bare" and
  why.
- **`lane-report.md`** — the report shape a merge gate consumes verbatim.
  A brief's `REPORT BACK:` line should demand exactly its sections.
- **`handoff.md`** — the report's sibling for `release_owner: "external"`
  runs: what equips the external owner to release (`clodex-ship` §7A).

When the ask you are classifying (§4) *is* a lane brief from an orchestrator,
say so, run the core path, and let the brief's REPORT BACK contract shape the
exit report.

---

## Common mistakes

| Mistake | Instead |
|---|---|
| Inventing an event name | The vocabulary is frozen at 23 names and the reducer refuses anything else; the full list is the `e` enum in `$CLODEX_HOME/state/schemas/event.schema.json`. This skill appends only four of them: `run:opened`, `run:closed`, `release:updated`, `approval:granted`. Something the names do not cover is a **field** on one of them — see the telemetry block above. |
| Reporting preflight only in chat | Chat is a transcript, and answering "was this environment verified?" from a transcript is the gap this field closes. It goes in `run:opened` (§6), or on the resumed session's first event (§1). |
| Hand-editing `run.json` | It is derived. Append an event; `rebuild` regenerates it. |
| Building a repair/chore/sync lane on the fly | Name the shape, say it is deferred, propose the manual approach (§4). Audit is built — route it, do not hand-roll it. |
