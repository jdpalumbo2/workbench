"""The clodex run-state data contract: schemas, invariants, and the reduction.

`clodex_state.py` owns the files (event log, lock, snapshot) and the CLI; this
module owns what the data *means*. It ships alongside `schemas/` so that any
conforming implementation rebuilds identical state from the same events.

The reduction is pure — it reads no clock, no PID, no environment — so
`reduce_events(events)` is a function of the events alone, and every timestamp
in a snapshot came from an event, stamped once at append time.

Import via `clodex_state`, which re-exports everything a caller needs.
