"""clodex run state: append-only event log, deterministic reducer, lock, snapshot.

A run owns a directory (in real use `.clodex/<run-id>/`):

    events.ndjson   append-only log, one JSON object per line — authoritative
    run.json        snapshot: the reduction over events.ndjson — derived
    lock.json       session lock: who owns this run (identity, liveness)
    write.lock      write lock: an flock serializing the writes themselves

Events are the truth. The snapshot is a convenience that is rebuilt from the
events whenever it fails to load, fails schema validation, or lags the log.
The reduction lives in `reducer.py`, which must sit beside this file; it is
imported by path, not by name, so neither module needs to be on sys.path.

Two locks, two jobs
-------------------
They have different lifetimes, so they are different mechanisms:

* **`lock.json` — the session lock.** Who owns this run. Held across many
  writes, carries the holder's PID and ISO timestamp, reports whether that
  holder is still running, and is only ever removed explicitly (`break_lock`,
  `unlock`). A writer that finds someone else's session lock raises `RunLocked`
  rather than writing; resume-or-abort is the caller's decision. Ownership is
  re-entrant for the holder and is delegated to child processes through the
  `CLODEX_LOCK_TOKEN` environment variable.

* **`write.lock` — the write lock.** An advisory `fcntl.flock` held for the
  duration of every write, taken unconditionally: by the session-lock holder
  and by every token-carrying delegate alike. Contention here is normal and
  brief, so it waits (up to `WRITE_LOCK_TIMEOUT`) instead of refusing. This is
  what actually serializes writers, so the session lock never has to designate
  a writer *set* that can race with itself.

Because of the write lock, delegates may run concurrently:

    with acquire_lock(run_dir):                       # this session owns the run
        append_event(run_dir, {"e": "run:opened"})
        atomic_write_snapshot(run_dir, rebuild(run_dir))
        subprocess.run([... "clodex_state.py", "append", run_dir], ...)   # any number,
        subprocess.run([... "clodex_state.py", "append", run_dir], ...)   # in parallel

Nothing an ordinary call can do puts an unreadable event into the log:
`append_event` reduces the log plus the candidate event *before* writing, so an
event that would break the run is refused while the log is still clean.

Library use:

    seq  = append_event(run_dir, {"e": "run:opened", "lane": "feature"})
    snap = rebuild(run_dir)          # pure reduction; rebuild(d) == rebuild(d)
    snap = load_snapshot(run_dir)    # validates, else rebuilds

CLI use (payloads travel by stdin by default; `-e` takes one inline event):

    echo '{"e": "run:opened"}' | python3 clodex_state.py append <run_dir>
    python3 clodex_state.py append <run_dir> -e '{"e": "stage:plan:entered"}'
    python3 clodex_state.py rebuild <run_dir>
    python3 clodex_state.py status  <run_dir>
    python3 clodex_state.py boundary-check <run_dir> [--owned <path>]... [--baseline <file>]
    python3 clodex_state.py telemetry-sync <run_dir> <runner_dir>
    python3 clodex_state.py runs    <main_checkout>
    python3 clodex_state.py unlock  <run_dir>

CLI exit codes:

    0  success. For `append`, the event is in the log AND run.json is current;
       the assigned seq is on stdout.
    1  refused, nothing written. Safe to retry.
    2  usage error.
    3  `append` only: the event is durably in the log but run.json was not
       refreshed. DO NOT retry the append — it would double-write an
       append-only log. `rebuild` still reports correct state.
