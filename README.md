**Claude Code skills I actually run, maintain, and get asked for.**

Published because people building their own agents keep wanting copies — but
make no mistake about the audience: these are made **for me, for people like
me, by people like me**. People who'd rather build a tool that fits their own
hands than adopt someone else's framework. If a skill here fits yours too,
take it.

*Formerly `claude-skills`; renamed August 2026. The old URL redirects.*

## How a skill works

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md`: the YAML frontmatter `description` is
the trigger (Claude reads it to decide when the skill applies), and the body is
the process it follows once loaded. Drop the directory into `~/.claude/skills/`
and it's live in your next session.

## Install

This repo is the canonical source — my `~/.claude/skills` entries are symlinks
into it, so `git pull` updates every installed skill at once:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jdpalumbo2/workbench
ln -s "$(pwd)/workbench/skills/jp-frontend-design" ~/.claude/skills/jp-frontend-design
```

Install only what you'll use. The `clodex-*` stage skills expect the `clodex`
router installed beside them; everything else stands alone.

## Catalogue

Three shelves. The tables below say what each skill governs; each skill's own
README covers how it works, what it's good for, and who it's for.

### The clodex pipeline

A development workflow for Claude Code + Codex CLI: one front door, four
stages, and an audit lane. Claude orchestrates; Codex independently reviews
plans and code and implements under contract; every run is a durable event log
that survives a dead session. It descends from the
[TRIP workflow](https://github.com/PiLastDigit/TRIP-workflow) by PiLastDigit.

| Skill | What it governs |
|---|---|
| [clodex](skills/clodex/) | The whole pipeline: routing, staged `plan → build → verify → ship` execution, and the read-only audit lane. The five `clodex-*` stage skills install beside it; the full control-flow graph — actors, review loops, failure paths — lives in [its README](skills/clodex/README.md), for anyone who digs that deep |

The pipeline's contract is deliberately inspectable: plans choose from five
evidence classes (`tests`, `real-data`, `live-check`, `visual`,
`client-artifact`), and Codex calls return runner-owned envelopes with input
hashes from invocation start plus an end observation when available; legacy
resumed inputs are marked unknown. The stage skills' contract advances a stage
only on a valid `complete` envelope (a prose discipline, not a reducer
invariant). First-use bootstrap data is checked against `skills/clodex/VERSION`,
and delegated approvals are explicitly attributed — a run-scoped mandate binds
to the run when it opens and is revoked by a plan amendment.

### Rigor

Three skills, one discipline, three targets: `dialectical-review` attacks a
**position**, `empirical-falsification` attacks a **fact**,
`red-team-pressure-test` attacks **execution**. They compose — an adversarial
pass is only as good as the facts it's arguing over — and they exist for
everything that already doesn't have a dedicated review lane the way code does.

| Skill | What it governs |
|---|---|
| [dialectical-review](skills/dialectical-review/) | Pressure-testing a strategy or belief in one reasoning pass: state it as its strongest thesis, build the real antithesis, find the synthesis that survives both |
| [empirical-falsification](skills/empirical-falsification/) | Checking a claim against real search evidence instead of recalled confidence, following citation chains to a primary source or two dead ends, and reporting holds / falsified / partially true |
| [red-team-pressure-test](skills/red-team-pressure-test/) | Dispatching a genuinely independent adversarial subagent to find every gap and weak assumption in a plan before a client, stakeholder, or reality does |

### Standalone

| Skill | What it governs |
|---|---|
| [jp-frontend-design](skills/jp-frontend-design/) | The ORDER of frontend design work: brief → tokens → hero screen → screenshot-critique loop → scale out. A process skill, built to run beside a craft-level design skill |
| [lane-orchestration](skills/lane-orchestration/) | Deterministic overnight orchestration for clodex lanes: quota meters, dry-run dispatch plans, park/unpark, budget gates. Replaces opus-orchestration (renamed 2026-09-01). |
| [agentmail-onboard](skills/agentmail-onboard/) | Onboarding a new email + Telegram agent against an agentmail control plane, one runbook step at a time, with every outbound send behind a human approval tap |
| [vinyl-dig](skills/vinyl-dig/) | A parallel record-shop crawl: one subagent per shop, prices benchmarked against Discogs, deduped against your collection, and a tiered buy list at the end |

  `jp-frontend-design` adapt ideas from Anthropic's

- `clodex` and its stage skills descend from the
  [TRIP workflow](https://github.com/PiLastDigit/TRIP-workflow) by PiLastDigit
  (MIT) — the stage vocabulary and the Codex review roles originate there.
- The three rigor skills — `dialectical-review`, `empirical-falsification`,
  and `red-team-pressure-test` — took shape with help from my friend Lisa
  Larbi, whose thinking runs through all three.
